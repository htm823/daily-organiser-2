# 📆 Daily Organiser

Daily Organiser is a simple task management application built with vanilla JavaScript.  
It is designed to help organise daily tasks with categories, filtering, and a clean, minimal interface.

The project focuses on clear structure, fundamental JavaScript logic, and incremental improvement.

## ✨ Features

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD)
- Assign categories to tasks (Work / Personal)
- Filter tasks by category (All / Work / Personal)
- Mark tasks as completed with a strikethrough effect
- Custom-styled checkbox for improved visual clarity
- Clear all tasks with a single action
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Persist tasks using localStorage

## 🧠 How It Works

- Tasks are stored in localStorage to persist data between sessions
- Filtering is handled by separating application state from UI rendering
- UI updates are driven by task state changes rather than direct DOM manipulation
- The project is implemented without frameworks to focus on core JavaScript fundamentals

## 🎨 Design Notes

- Minimal and distraction-free layout
- Clear visual hierarchy and spacing
- Responsive design already in place, with room for further refinement
- UI decisions prioritise clarity and usability over visual complexity
